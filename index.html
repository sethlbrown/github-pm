<p>We've tried a lot of project management systems over the years. In some way,
they have always seemed lacking, confusing or just a pain in the rear end. If
they had good tools for project managers, they were confusing to developers. If
they were useful for developers, designers complained about the eye-sores. No
one system ever seemed to satisfy the team.</p>

<p>We recently started using GitHub for project management after the developers
started raving about how much they loved it for their code tools. To our
surprise, GitHub has a lot of very competent organizational tools that can
benefit any given project. Our designers even started using it for some of their
own projects, which I think says something about GitHub's aesthetics. With a
little bit of something for each role, GitHub is starting to come out on top as
the tool of choice for hosting code, managing projects, and greatly facilitating
project communication to boot!</p>

<p>Some of the things I'd like to show you are not entirely dependent upon GitHub,
but are good practices in general. However, I'll be mostly talking about how we
are doing these things within GitHub and how we're using GitHub's tools for
accomplishing our project goals. So, whether or not you like GitHub as a tool
for your projects, I hope you will at least get something out of this.</p>

<h2>Project Introductions</h2>

<p>GitHub is pretty developer-centric. As such, the first thing a developer sees
when they open a project, is a view of the code repository. Below that, GitHub
automatically renders the README file found in the root of the code base. It's a
very typical practice for software projects, especially open source software
projects, to have this file in place. The README can be in various formats, but
a favorite of mine is <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.
Simply giving the README an extension of .md tells GitHub to render your
README.md using the Markdown syntax. But even better, is that GitHub has it's
own <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/">flavor of markdown</a>.
Being that the developers of your project see the README first, this is a great
place for information that will get them up and running with the project as
quickly as possible. Be concise. If you need to write more than a few sentences,
chances are, you should be linking off to more in-depth documentation in your
project's wiki. Here's a quick guideline of some of the things that you might
want to include within your README.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A quick project overview.</p>

<p>Give a few sentences of the project's goals and maybe a small bit of
background. Any links that you frequently access are also good to throw up
at the top as well, for easy access. Everyone loves easy access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information about the directory structure.</p>

<p>Typically we have more than just Drupal in our repository root, so it's
helpful to have a brief description of what is in there. We typically have a
<a href="https://github.com/Lullabot/drupal-boilerplate/tree/master/drush">drush folder</a>
for aliases and commands, as well as a patches directory with it's own README.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to get started developing.</p>

<p>Tell the developers what the best way to jump into the project might be.
Things like, "clone this repo, create a feature branch, and send a pull
request for review. Whomever reviews the pull request should also do things
like remove the remote branch from the repository once it is merged."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development process.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to outline your development process, as it may change from
project to project. Do you want people to fork your repository and send pull
requests; create feature branches and send pull requests; or just go ahead
and commit to master? Let the developers know up-front, so there's no
confusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environments.</p>

<p>Outline information for your dev, staging and live environments, if you have
them. Also, outline the process for getting things to the various places.
How do I make sure my code is on staging? What is the best way to grab a
database dump? We like to setup drush aliases for each environment ahead of
time as a means of outlining this information and giving developers a good
starting point. Then document some example commands for doing some typical
operations. <a href="https://github.com/Lullabot/drupal-boilerplate/blob/master/drush/aliases/example.aliases.drushrc.php">Here's an example</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Links to where to find more information.</p>

<p>Typically this is our wiki, where we keep more detailed documentation and
notes on things; project details like the original proposal's SOW,
credentials to environments, Scrum Notes, Pre-launch checklists, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>We've attempted to create a <a href="https://github.com/Lullabot/drupal-boilerplate">drupal-boilerplate</a>,
of sorts, for our Drupal projects which we're continuously re-using for new
projects and modifying when we find things that work better. Take a look, and if
you find it useful, please feel free to use it! If you find anything missing, or
have ideas on improving it, please fork it and send us a pull request!</p>

<h2>Working with GitHub Issues</h2>

<p>GitHub has a pretty simple issue management system for bug tracking, but it is
flexible enough to be a pretty powerful tool for managing entire projects, large
and small. It has issues which can reference each-other; tags for attaching meta
data to your issues; methods for attaching code to your issues; and even
milestones for grouping and focusing your issues within time blocks.</p>

<h3>Referencing and Association</h3>

<p>Issues can be associated with each other by simply throwing an #issue-number
(ex: #3) within the body of another issue. This is useful in many ways. Firstly,
it keeps the relationship simple. We don't have to worry about what kind of
relationship it is (parent/sibling/child) just that it's related. However, there
are a couple of tricks that make this a little more useful if you understand how
it works. Let me give you an example.</p>

<p>Let's say you typically create an issue for a content type, and one of the
fields on that content type is a taxonomy vocabulary. You probably want to break
that vocabulary creation out into it's own issue. So you create the issue for the
news content type
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120607-kday7nnj62xedpty25yxgmbd93.jpg" alt="news-content-type"></p>

<p>and then you create an issue for the taxonomy vocabulary and, within your
description, link to the news issue.
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120607-gah6niabiwa1ybae99rmccnii9.jpg" alt="tags-taxonomy"></p>

<p>Just by putting in the #ticket-number (in this case #4) GitHub creates a link to
the news issue AND it places a back-link reference within the news issue to your
tags issue!
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120607-fkc64xhq47sq5ph7bj48d3ffnj.jpg" alt="news-tags"></p>

<p>As a part of this reference you will notice that it also gives you the status of
the referenced issue. Very handy for whomever is assigned this news issue. They
can easily see the status of it's 'dependency'. I use that term loosely because
it is a dependency in this instance, but not always.</p>

<h3>Issue Tags</h3>

<p>Tags are a simple and effective way to add meta data to your issues. A lot of
systems tend to create fields and categories with various values in an effort to
allow you finite control of the meta data for an issue. I've found the simple
tagging system that GitHub employs to be very efficient and more flexible.</p>

<p>GitHub comes with a few tags by default: bug, duplicate, enhancement, invalid,
question, and won't fix. These give you a good idea of how to start using tags.
For example, "bug" is a type of issue, while "won't fix" is more of a status.
Tags can be anything, and if chosen wisely, can give any developer an immediate
clue as to what sort of ticket it is, what section it might apply to, or what
status it is in at a quick glance.</p>

<p>While they're useful for developers, they're also good for the organizer of the
project in that they serve as a great filtering mechanism as well. For instance,
just by selecting various tags, I can see all of the issues that are "migration"
issues for "taxonomy", or "content types".
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120607-kfqtrgq148ywk7xxp24fcy74wp.jpg" alt="content-migration"></p>

<h3>Attach Code to an Existing Issue</h3>

<p>Pull requests are an amazing tool for code collaboration. If you're new to the
concept, check out this <a href="https://vimeo.com/41045197">pull request demo</a>. It's a
quick and easy way for developers to basically create a copy of the code base
(by either forking or branching) and suggesting modifications to the existing
code, or contributing new code. It allows the other members of the project to
then review that code, make their own suggestions with in-line commenting, and
then make a decision as to whether to merge it into the main code base or not.
We've found the in-line commenting with pull requests to be immensely useful
since they keep everyone in the project in the loop with changes that are
happening.
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120609-e6pfy9sts7nbi2p3kw4um1iikx.jpg" alt="code-comments"></p>

<p>Pull requests in general are a great means of peer review and have helped to
keep the quality of our code up to everyone's standards. There's a bit of
overhead in that it may take a little longer for some new piece of code to be
merged in, so plan accordingly. But this also means we find bugs sooner,
typically before they're actually introduced into the system.</p>

<p>One of the gripes I had with pull requests, was that when you create one through
GitHub's web interface, it basically creates a new issue. And though you can
certainly reference a particular issue within your pull request, it's still a
separate issue. However, through a nice command-line tool called <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/hub">Hub</a>,
we've found there is a way to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suS3lDn20HY">turn issues into pull requests</a>!
Very handy for keeping your discussions and code all in one place and not having
to deal with multiple issues about the same thing.</p>

<h3>Milestones</h3>

<p>GitHub has a mechanism for milestones that is actually quite typical of many
project systems these days. When you create a new milestone, it simply has a
title, description, and a date choosing mechanism.
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120609-4nfhurufifhbxpic32j1ynt1b.jpg" alt="milestone"></p>

<p>You can have a nice overview during the week that gives you the percentage of
completion.
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120609-1kcnp51njk55qqb71nfh5dssii.jpg" alt="closed"></p>

<p>We tend to only plan one sprint ahead, but there is a milestone created for each
week up until the end of the project. By seeing that there are 5 more sprints
without issues, you can easily tell that there are 5 more weeks left until the
end of the project.
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120609-fbaj8534tjhmt2t7jc661pquky.jpg" alt="open"></p>

<p>We grab these tickets from the Backlog, which is essentially just any ticket
that is <strong>not</strong> in a Sprint.
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120609-tx4b1a2iebb1a7i1f5higsdrf.jpg" alt="backlog"></p>

<h3>Sprint Methodology</h3>

<p>Most agile scrum projects tend to go with two week sprints. I've recently found
that one week sprints are even better. With such a limited scope, it's much
easier to keep track of things in your head, like what needs to be done, when it
needs to be done, and to keep the general goal of the week in mind at all times.
It also has the added benefit of making meetings shorter, and who doesn't want
shorter meetings?!. Two week sprint reviews and sprint planning meetings are
usually around 1 hour each, but with a more limited scope we've been able to
keep our sprint planning and review meetings to about half an hour total on
Fridays.</p>

<h2>Huboard</h2>

<p>One area in GitHub's issue tracking system I have found a bit lacking for
project management, is the lack of a mechanism for prioritizing your issues. You
could probably come up with tags for High, Medium and Low-priority, but I tend
to prefer an ordered list with the highest priority things on top.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/rauhryan/huboard">Huboard</a>, which gives you a nice
Kanban-style interface (similar to <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>) right on top
of the GitHub api. You're looking at your GitHub issues, but with a different
interface. The instructions for setting this up are quite sufficient, so I'll
not re-iterate those, but I've found that it's quite easy and quick to setup on
<a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> with very little maintenance overhead. With
Huboard, we now have a means of seeing what the priority tasks are for the week
and it gives developers an easy way to see what they should work on next.

<hr><p>So while GitHub does have many things we need to make a project successful,
there are a couple places it may be lacking slightly. However, the team over at
GitHub is continually making improvements to their product and they <a href="https://github.com/blog/">blog</a>
about it often.</p>

<p>I also think that there is probably a better means of exposing some of the
typical project information for stakeholders and clients in a way they can
understand. GitHub is great for the technically-minded person, but less
tech-savvy people may not find it as attractive. I'm still working on ways to
report on progress to project stakeholders in a more visual way easy and when I
find one I like, I plan to update you all.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions on things we might also do to improve our process,
or would like to share with us some of the exciting things you're doing with
your own processes, please hit us up in the comments section! We'd love to hear
from you! And remember, Lullabot loves you!</p>
